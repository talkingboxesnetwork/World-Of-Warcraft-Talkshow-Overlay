# World Of Warcraft Talkshow Overlay

Welcome to the World Of Warcraft Talkshow Overlay Project. This project is designed to give you a simple chat show overlay with in the realm of world of warcraft.

## Install

This overlay set makes use of the move transition plugin, to install follow the instructions here:

https://github.com/exeldro/obs-move-transition/releases/tag/1.1.3

Unzip the Folder so the file structure is C:/World-Of-Warcraft-Talkshow-Overlay ** 

Open World-Of-Warcraft-Talkshow-Overlay/Assets/Fonts and install the lifecraft font

Open OBS > Scene Collection > Import

Next Go to World-Of-Warcraft-Talkshow-Overlay/Install and select Talk_Show__World_of_Warcraft.JSON

Once imported and enjoy using the overlay. 

## Structure

The main talking scene is -- CAMERAS -- this will have all cameras in a flat state. 

If you wish to make a camera zoom, then there is a scene that names the camera element that its going to bring to the foreground.

My best experience of making this appear super professional is to have each it bound to a function key or if alternatively the more expensive option a stream deck.
